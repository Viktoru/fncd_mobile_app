## Download [app-release.apk]()

The release file called app-release.apk can be uploaded and downloaded on your Android phone. It is compatible with the earlier versions.

The APK file format is used by the Android operating system for distribution and installation of mobile apps.

With an APK file, you are essentially getting an app. Most users get apps from the Google Play Store. In this case, I can get the app in Google Play, but for testing purposes we are going to leave it in this repository. In the future I will add it.

- Download the app-release.apk file on your computer.
- Once you've downloaded the APK file on your computer, connect your Android device to it.
- At this point, you may be asked if you want to charge your phone or connect it as a 'media device.' Choose Media device.
- Then, find your phone's folder on your computer. It will be in 'My Computer' or 'Computer' on Windows (PC).
- Copy the APK file into a folder of your choice in your Android smartphone.
- You will now be able to search for the file location in the My files folder of your device.
- Find the APK file, tap it, then hit Install.
